When multiple people are working on a repo, it is usually best to have a branch unique to one person if they are all changing the same files to prevent commit conflicts.
It is also best to have a current working version (master), and a development version under a different name just in case the development branch gets broken or ruined, you can always return to the master branch.

'git log' is a history of all the commits in a repository, and 'git status' is the current difference in the branch from the last commit.

(g)

'git log -p'

(h)

git log --grep="file"

Inheritance is the idea of creating classes the share the same functions and follow the same conventions, but separate themselves into more detail. For example, in this project we have a "child class" CommonSword that inherits from its "parent class" Weapon because a common sword is a weapon, but not every weapon is a common sword.
Polymorphism is having a function in a parent class that has no definition, but allows child classes to specify that function, while also enforcing that function should exits.
Encapsulation is the idea of keeping certain member functions and data from being used or modified outside of that class or child classes.
